					<a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> layers may now be imported into <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html">After Effects</a> without redrawing everything in Illustrator. Avoid the startling realization that you have to repeat the whole import process simply because you forgot to split one element out onto its own layer or that type has to be converted into live text as an additional process per layer.</p>
					<p class="text-center"> Quickly export selected layers or a whole artboard from Sketch with type metrics, transform data, images, symbol hierarchy, and grouping intact. It's little bit better than the native Illustrator =&gt; AE import. Hooray.

						Sketch2AE v0.54 is the current version and works with Sketch 49+. If you are using an older version of Sketch, download <a href="https://aeux.io/Download/Sketch2AE_0.53.zip">Sketch2AE v0.53</a>.

					<h3 id="copy-new">1. Copy to new Sketch File</h3>
					<p>
					Select your artboard, create a new Sketch file, paste artboard into new file. <br><br><i>**This step is optional but recommended.**</i><br>
					Why? Complexity within a Sketch file can vary from user to user. In order to find all the symbols in a file, the plugin has to run through all the symbols to
					find the right one. This can take long time from a stickersheet or similar heavy file.
					</p>

					<img src="./sketch2ae_files/Sketch2AE_Artboard.png">
					<h3 id="setup">2. Setup the artboard</h3>
					<p>
					Inside of Sketch, assets are allowed to float loose within the file without an Artboard (like in a stickersheet).
					This is totally cool for working in Sketch, but in order for Sketch2AE to know how big to draw everything within
					an AE comp, we need an artboard. The size of the artboard will be the bounds of the comp, so set this
					size correctly.
					<br><br>
					Keyboard shortcut <b>A</b> in Sketch allows you to define a new artboard if needed.

				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<img src="./sketch2ae_files/Sketch2AE_Select.png">
					<h3 id="select">3. Select layers</h3>
					<p>
					Drag a bounding box over all the art within your artboard to select all visible layers, or select specific layers for export.
					Selecting this way will skip non-visible layers that may only exist in the artboard for reference.
					<br><br>
					Or select the artboard itself to select all the layers (hidden or visible). That's your call, dude.

					<img src="./sketch2ae_files/Sketch2AE_Grouping.gif">
					<h3 id="grouping">Grouping</h3>
					<p>
					<i>Groups</i> aren't exactly a thing inside of AE, but they really should be. To support the grouping of elements, <i>Sketch2AE</i> will create a bounding box layer as a parent to the grouped layers. This parent layer will be inactive and set as shy to keep the comp from cluttering. Manually activate these layers (click the eyeball), or click the <i>Group Visibility</i> button to toggle all of these grouping layers.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<img src="./sketch2ae_files/Sketch2AE_Symbols.png">
					<h3 id="symbol">Symbols</h3>
					<p>
					One of the most powerful Sketch features is Symbols. An element can exist in multiple locations and artboards and point back to a single reference for quick updating. Hmmm... that sounds a lot like a precomp.
					Sketch Symbols will be created as precomps at their native size, scaled as needed and reused in master comps.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<img src="./sketch2ae_files/Sketch2AE_Gradients.png">
					<h3 id="gradient">Gradients as images</h3>
					<p>
					Great care has been taken to import as many editable (and animatable) properties as possible. One property that AE doesn't import well is gradients (the gradient edit panel is not scriptable). To get around this, Sketch2AE will export gradient fills, gradient strokes, image fills, and textures as image of the layer.

						<h3 id="image-rendering">Image Rendering and Position Offset</h3>
						<p>
							Image effects like <i>Blur</i> and <i>Color Adjustment</i> will be rendered with the exported images to preserve their design in Sketch. Sometimes these effects can increase the bounds of a layer larger than the metrics say it is. This leads to a position offset of the layer, pushing it down and to the right. Some manual adjustment will be required in AE to correct this. <br><br>
							Thick strokes on rendered images (with gradients and textures) will also result in this position offset – Something to be aware of.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-3">
						<h3 id="text-misalignment">Text Misalignment</h3>
						<p>
							It happens. Sorry about that. The math that sorts the differences between Sketch and AE can't catch everything (especially multi-line text strings). The good news is that the text is live and can be easily edited and realigned.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-3">
						<h3 id="shape-rotation">Shape Rotation</h3>
						<p>
							Since Sketch has no concept of an anchor point, shape rotation is based purely on the object center. This means that shape rotation is possible to support and retain accurate positioning. <b>Layers &gt; Combine &gt; Flatten</b> all paths to ensure correct importing.
